# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
The web app server ec2 instance was being brute force attacked by the attack simulator to obtain access via ssh by guessing the password of the instance.
We can see the ip address of both the instances in GuardDuty.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
AWS GuardDuty monitors and detects any malicious activity by analyzing events from sources such as AWS CloudTrail Management Events (AWS user and API activity in your accounts), AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Events (Amazon S3 activity), Amazon VPC Flow Logs (network traffic data), and DNS Logs (name query patterns).
