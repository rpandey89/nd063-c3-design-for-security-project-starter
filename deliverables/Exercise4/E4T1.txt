# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. We should remove the ingress rule of 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22 in the security group so that ssh access is not at all available to the app instance from anywhere over the internet.
2. Keep ingress rule only on ports required to access webapp i.e. 5000 or 80
3. Give ssh access to user group that assume a certain role with least privileges

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Enable server side encryption on secret recipes bucket
2. Disable public access
3. Enable secure socket layer access
4. Create IAM policy that can provide read and write access to certain profiles
5. Assign users that require access to the policy defined above
