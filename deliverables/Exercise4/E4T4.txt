# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1. Disallow traffic trying to connect to instances via UDP in the security group
2. Enable s3 buckets to allow connections on SSL
3. Move the web application instance in a private subnet

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
I think it will be still insecure because the attacker can still access the s3 endpoints by accessing it through doing SSH into a publicly exposed EC2 instance.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
The existing data will not be encrypted only the data that will be added further will be encrypted.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
I think using the original cloud formation templates will take us back to original less secure application stack.
